				<h2>Bio</h2>
				<p>I am currently a Sophomore studying Computer Science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. I am looking for an internship in web development and/or Android/iOS development. Last year I interned at American Renewable Energy as an office assistant and I learned how to manage and deal with people under stressful situations. Years before that I worked at Fruity Yogurt as a barista/cashier where I learned how to stay organized and I never lost a penny during my stay there. I just started working as a product manager at Gigster and I will update this when I have accomplished something there. I currently know Java, Python, HTML5, and CSS. This summer I will be learning JavaScript/JQuery and C++. Here is my <a href="rebeccaturesume.pdf">resume</a> if you would like to learn more about me.</p>
